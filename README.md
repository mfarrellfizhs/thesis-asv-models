# Fake Speech Detector
A comparison of deep learning and machine learning model to detect synthetic speech generated by the use of Voice Conversion, Text-To-Speech, and TTS_VC

# Features
- Detects fake speech with high accuracy and low EER
- Comparison between 3 machine learning models and CNN

## CNN Model Details
The model is based on a CNN architecture inspired by [Hernández-Nava et al](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1740).
- **EER (Validation):** 0.19%
- **EER (Evaluation):** 6.00%
